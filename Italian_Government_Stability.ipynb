From the results we can observe that our initial hypothesis wasn't a misconception as in the first case we end up with a predicted strong stability while in the second we have a weak one. This can be explained if we consider that a government founded on a large support may encounter more problems when it comes to clashes in political agendas between parties.

The idea of multiple points of view being a winning trait is also appearent in the other result about majority division, which is fragmented, suggesting that, if a fragmented majority succeeds in putting aside some of its differences, it may be capable of support the longest lived governments. This should't be too surprising as it's one of the basis for a parliamentary republic, which Italy is.

Each nation has, however, the possiblity of changing these rules, in order to adapt them. In Italy the reform of the constitution is an extraordinary procedure which requirese strict conditions in order to avoid degenerative reforms. In order to perform a revision of the constitution, it's mandatory to have a so called 'Constitutional Supermajority' of over 66% of the parliament in both houses or a simple majority vote followed by a popular referendum vote. Either way requires, however, a lot of time as this kind of reforms is usually quite difficult to pass, expecially using the direct supermajority approach. A possible option may be to join forces between multiple parties to agree upon the reforms. What we now want to ask the model is: assuming we obtain the required supermajority, we first want to know which are the best conditions under which it can form in terms of numbers of parties forming it and internal division. Then, using these parameters we'll compute the stability of such government and its predicted fall cause.  </p>"
